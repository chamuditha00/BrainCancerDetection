# Brain Tumor Detection Model

This repository contains a Python script for detecting brain tumors using deep learning. The model is trained on a dataset containing MRI images of brain tumors and can classify them into four classes: glioma, meningioma, non-tumor, and pituitary tumor.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
